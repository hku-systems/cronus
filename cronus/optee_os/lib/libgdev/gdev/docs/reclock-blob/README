This document describes how to use frequency scaling in NVIDIA driver. It
conducts by modifying the GPU card's VBIOS. Using envytools can modify VBIOS.


1. Install envytools

Envytools is a rich set of open-source tools to compile or decompile NVIDIA
GPU program code, firmware code, macro code, and so on. It is also used to
generate C header files with GPU command definitions.


cd $(TOPDIR)
git clone git://github.com/envytools/envytools.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. # may require some packages on your distro
make
sudo make install # will install tools to /usr/local/{bin,lib}

You'll need: cmake, libxml2, libxml2-dev, libpciaccess-dev, flex, bison



2. Unload NVIDIA driver and extract the card's VBIOS

nvagetbios extracts the card's VBIOS using the method given as parameter and
writes it to stdout. 


cd ${TOPDIR}
sudo modprobe -r nvidia
sudo /usr/local/bin/nvagetbios > vbios.rom



3.  Decode the card's VBIOS

nvbios decodes the card description structures found in NVIDIA VBIOS.


nvbios vbios.rom > vbios.rom.dump



4. Modify the card's VBIOS

Open vbios.rom.dump by a text editor. You will find the place setting
frequency like this.
# Contents of vbios.rom.dump depend on GPU cards.

Configuration of [ID 0xf] is valid in default, because ID at the bottom is
active.  Configuration of [ID 0xf] means GPU run by core frequency in 700MHz,
memory frequency in 135MHz, and shader frequency in 1401MHz. If you want to
use the configuration of [ID 0xc], you make configuration of [ID 0xf] invalid.
Changing [6208: 0f] under the [ID 0xf] to [6208: ff] by using nvafakebios, [ID
0xf] become invalid. Similarly, changing [61c4: 0c] to [61c4: ff] is invalid
[ID 0xc]. This is an example of how to disable the [ID 0xf].


sudo /usr/local/bin/nvafakebios -e 6208:ff vbios.rom



5. Load NDIVIA driver 

If you load NVIDIA driver, setting frequency is valid.


sudo modprobe nvidia



6. Extra frequency setting

If you change only core frequency, or only memory frequency, you must analyze
file of vbios.rom.dump. For example, 

	...

        0:6190: 2a 83 00 00

        3:619c: 2a 83 00 00
        4:61a0: 2a 83 00 00
        5:61a4: 44 81 00 00
        6:61a8: 95 01 00 00
	...

        0:61d4: 2a 83 00 00
        1:61d8: 2a 83 00 00
        2:61dc: 95 01 00 00
        3:61e0: 2a 83 00 00
        4:61e4: 2a 83 00 00
        5:61e8: 38 47 00 00
        6:61ec: 95 01 00 00
	...

-- ID 0xf Core 700MHz Memory 1848MHz Shader 1401MHz ...
6208: 0f 00 02 08 ...
        0:6218: 79 45 00 00
        1:621c: 79 45 00 00
        2:6220: 1c 02 00 00
        3:6224: 79 45 00 00
        4:6228: c0 45 00 00
        5:622c: 38 47 00 00
        6:6230: 1c 02 00 00
	... 

[5:61a4 44 81], [5:61e8 38 47], and [5:622c 38 47] are estimated setting of
memory frequency. [44 81] of [5:61a4 44 81] means 0x144(324) by transposing
and ignoring first bit. [38 47] of [5:61e8 38 47] means 0x738(1848) by the
same token. Therefor, you change [5:622c 38 47] to [5:622c 44 81], GPU run by
core frequency in 700MHz, memory frequency in 324MHz and shader frequency in
1401MHz. This command change [5:622c 38 47] to [5:622c 44 81].


# use this command instead of Step 4
sudo /usr/local/bin/nvafakebios -e 622c:44 -e 622d:81 vbios.rom



7. How to use script
You can use this script to check selectable frequency on your GPU card after
step 2. 

./nvclock-lockup.sh vbios.rom # You need to install bc


If you want to run GPU by core frequency in 405MHz, and memory frequency in
324MHz, you use this script like this after step 2. 

# use this script in a superuser
./nvclock-set.sh -c 405 -m 324 vbios.rom


We don't recommend using the lowest core frequency without using the lowest
memory frequency, because there are lack of stability. If you fail memory or
core clock up, please reboot your machine.  We check the script working in
Geforce GTX 480, but we don't know this script work well in other GPU cards.
